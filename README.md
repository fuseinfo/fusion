Fusion
======

Fusion is a highly extensible data processing framework to enable users to quickly create 
Apache Spark applications, such as an extract, transform, and load (ETL)
application. Fusion has various readers to extract data from many sources
and convert them to Spark DataFrame for further processing. Fusion also has
various writer to load Spark DataFrame into data store, such as data lake or
Apache Kafka. Fusion also acts as the task orchestrator to resolve task
dependencies and use an internal variable system to allow data exchange among
tasks.

## Installation

#### Software Requirements
1. JDK 8 (Supports OpenJDK and Oracle JDK)
2. Apache Spark 2.4.x
3. winutils If runs on Microsoft Windows


## Quick Start
1. Set environment variable SPARK_HOME if spark-submit is not in the PATH
2. (On Linux/Mac) `tar -xzvf fusion-0.2.4-bin.tar.gz ` 
(On Windows), unzip fusion-0.2.4-bin.zip
3. Run `bin/fusion-sandbox.sh` on Linux/Mac or `bin\fusion-sandbox.cmd` on Windows
4. On web browser, open the link http://localhost:14080/ 


## Use Fusion
Fusion uses YAML format to store configuration. The default name of the main configuration is `Fusion.yaml`.
Users can specify a different yaml file in the command line to start Fusion.  

In the configuration, we can add one or more root level nodes to define tasks. 
The node name is the name of the task. 
Each task is processed by a task processor. There are many pre-built task processors. 
Alternatively, users can extend the com.fuseinfo.fusion.FusionFunction class to create new task processor.
By default, Fusion will execute the tasks one after another upon completion. 
We can also set a task to run in background mode.
So, the next task would be started immediately without waiting for the completion of the previous task.
To enable background mode, we can append an & at the end of the task name.
 
If we are not going to pass any parameter to a task processor, 
we can directly set the name of the task processor or the class name of the task processor a the String value of the root level node.
If we want to provide one or more parameters to the task processor, we can make the node as a Map.
In the Map node, we need to provide an attribute `__class` with the value as the name or Java class of the task processor.
Optionally, we may provide an attribute `__deps` with the value as a list of previous task names, separated by comma.
In this case, Fusion will make sure all these tasks were completed successfully before starting this task.
Other attributes would be provided to the task processor as parameters.

## Advanced Topics
#### Variables and Commands
We can use variables to pass information from the runtime environment to the application or from task to task.
We can define a variable in the Fusion command line by setting *var_name*=*value*  
In addition, all system environment variables can be referred as variable in Fusion.  
To use a variable, we can use the syntax to ${*varName*} in the configuration.
We can also provide a default value when the variable is not initialized as ${*varName*:-*defaultValue*}  
For example, we can set `${env:-prod}`.
In this case Fusion will try to retrieve if a variable called `env` is defined.
If it is defined the string will be replaced by the value of the variable. Otherwise, the value will be `prod`.

We may also run a command function and the output of the command function will be returned.
To run a Command, we can use the syntax $(*Command* *Parameter*)  
Command and variables can be nested. In another words, we can use variables as a parameter to a command, 
or use a command to form a default value of a variable.


#### Extensions
Some processors would persist output data. We can define one or more extension functions upon success or failure.
An extension function is an implementation of `Map[String, String] => Boolean`.
We can use extension to report lineage, statistics, as well as error handling.
